Qajax
===
A simple Promise-based ajax library based on [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).

**Qajax** is a simple and pure `XMLHttpRequest` wrapper.

Supported browsers
---

All browsers are supported (including IE).
Node.js is also supported via `xmlhttprequest` dependency.

Current master state is: [![Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/buildstatus/qajax)](https://saucelabs.com/u/qajax)

Installation
---

**Qajax** is a [NPM package](https://npmjs.org/package/qajax) that you can use from browserify and Node.js.

```json
dependencies: {
  "qajax": "1.0.x"
}
```

You can also use the library as standalone by taking `src/qajax.js` or `build/qajax.min.js`.

Usages and explanations
---

**Qajax** does not involve magic but does the strict minimum to work with **ajax** on all browsers (IE is supported!).

**Qajax** has been designed using **Promise** and split up into pure functions composable with `.then`.

The `Qajax` function **just** returns a successful **Promise of XHR** when the server has returned a result - whatever the `status` code is.


There are 3 possible signatures:

```javascript
Qajax(url: String) => Promise[XHR]
Qajax(options: Object) => Promise[XHR]
Qajax(url: String, options: Object) => Promise[XHR]
```

Simple usage:

```javascript
var promiseOfXHR = Qajax("/all.json");
// short version of: Qajax({ url: "/all.json", method: "GET" });
```

At this time, the promise is only rejected if the server has failed to reply to the client (network problem or timeout reached).

If you want to **filter only on success statuses**, then you need the `Qajax.filterSuccess` function:

```javascript
var promiseOfSuccessfulXHR =
  Qajax("/all.json").then(Qajax.filterSuccess);
```

But you can also **provide you own filter logic**:

```javascript
var promiseOf200XHR =
  Qajax("/all.json")
  .then(Qajax.filterStatus(function (code) {
    return code == 200; /* only support 200 */
  }));
```

And at the end you can **map it to a JSON**:

```javascript
var promiseOfJson =
  Qajax("/all.json")
  .then(Qajax.filterSuccess)
  .then(Qajax.toJSON);
```

Or you can use the getJSON shortcut for this specific use-case:

```javascript
var promiseOfJson = Qajax.getJSON("/all.json");
```

POST & submit data
---

Of-course, you can use other HTTP Verbs like POST with **Qajax**:

```javascript
Qajax({ url: "/entry", method: "POST" })
  .then(Qajax.filterSuccess)
  .get("responseText") // using a cool Q feature here
  .then(function (txt) {
    console.log("server returned: "+txt);
  }, function (err) {
    console.log("xhr failure: ", err);
  });
```

You can also submit some data as JSON:

```javascript
Qajax({ url: "/people", method: "POST", data: { name: "Gaetan", age: 23 } })
  .then(Qajax.filterSuccess)
  .then(doYourSuccessStuff, displayAnError)
  .done();
```

Helpers
---

**Qajax.serialize** helps you to deal with query string parameters:

```javascript
var lastYearYoungPeople =
  Qajax.getJSON("/people.json?"+Qajax.serialize({ from: "2012-01-01", to: "2013-01-01", "age$lt": 18 }));
  // will get from: "/people.json?from=2012-01-01&to=2013-01-01&age%24lt=18"
```

But alternatively, and more simply you can give a "params" object:

```javascript
var lastYearYoungPeople =
  Qajax({
    url: "/people.json",
    // This params object will be serialized in the URL
    params: {
      from: "2012-01-01",
      to: "2013-01-01",
      "age$lt": 18
    }
  }).then(Qajax.filterSuccess).then(Qajax.toJSON);
```

More advanced features
---

* You can get **progress** event of the Ajax download. Exemple:

```javascript
Qajax("/download").progress(function (xhrProgressEvent) {
  console.log(xhrProgressEvent);
});
```

See also: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/progress/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#progressevent

* Qajax has a **timeout**:

```javascript
var p = Qajax("/", { timeout: 5000 });
// p will be rejected if the server is not responding in 5 seconds.
```

The default timeout is `Qajax.defaults.timeout` and can be overriden.

* You can set XHR headers by giving the `header` options.

```javascript
var p = Qajax({ url: "/", headers: { "X-Foo": "bar" } });
```

* You can set withCredentials attribute for [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), see also: https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-withcredentials-attribute.

```javascript
var p = Qajax({ url: "http://another-domain.com/", withCredentials: true });
```

* You can give a `cancellation` Promise to abort an ajax request.

Here is a typical use case:

```javascript
var cancellationD = null;
function getResults (query) {
  if (cancellationD) {
    cancellationD.resolve();
  }
  cancellationD = Q.defer();
  return Qajax({
    url: "/search?"+Qajax.serialize({ q: query }),
    cancellation: cancellationD.promise
  })
  .then(Qajax.filterSuccess)
  .then(Qajax.toJSON);
}
/*
 * getResults can be called typically for a typeahead,
 * it ensures it never creates 2 requests at the same time,
 * the previous xhr is aborted if still running so it let the latest query have the priority.
 */
```

* More defaults:
  * log: Disable/Enable the logs
  * header: Global headers for all requests
  * base: A base url for all requests


Tests
---

The library is stress-tested with `qunit` and a mock node.js server which test different edge-cases like different HTTP code, method, server lag,...

Test locally: `grunt` and go to `http://localhost:9999/test/`.

* Replace `Qajax.defaults.logs` boolean by `Qajax.defaults.log` logging function. Usage Example: `Qajax.defaults.log=console.log.bind(console);`
